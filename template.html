    <p>&#8470;The website will offer an official summary of my definition, including my academic background, achievement, and basic details.</p>

    <p>&#8470;The website is mainly meant for professional purposes. Targeted people are people with connections, employers and people willing to engage me in something beneficial. It is not meant for social life. Most of my audiences will be aged 30-60 and from the US.</p>

    <p>&#8470;The website will have assistive technology to help people with disabilities. There will be screen readers that vocalize the text on each page to assist the blind. There will be speech recognition software that will be embedded with the website to help convert speech into text for people with hearing problem.</p>
